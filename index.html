        As a second year college student majoring in political science with a focus on pre-law studies, I am dedicated to building a strong foundation in both legal principles and political engagement. Throughout my academic career at the University of California, Riverside, I have made a commitment to developing a strong foundation of legal skills and political organization  through my involvement in Phi Alpha Delta, a professional pre-law fraternity. My experience in Phi Alpha Delta has given me a backbone in politics and has given me insight into the way government functions and the foundational values of the legal profession. To further enhance my political engagement, I took an internship at my local city hall as a political canvasser for a local mayoral campaign. This role let me directly be apart of the political system as I was able to see the dynamics of my local elections and involve myself with my community to bring education to my local town, shape public opinion, and bring people to vote. As a political canvasser, I went door to door in order to reach as many potential voters possible. After they answered the door, I would educate them on my candidate and promote his personal beliefs, policies, and ideas for office. Through daily conversations, I learned to address voter concerns with empathy and provide clear, accessible information about the candidateâ€™s platform and values. I also gained firsthand knowledge of the significance of comprehending legal frameworks, such as campaign finance rules and voter rights regulations, which are crucial to any political campaign, thanks to my canvassing experience. I gained knowledge of election procedures, the importance of compliance, and the moral principles that govern public relations campaigns.<br><br>

I'm now even more determined to study law in order to advance justice and equity in political processes as a result of this experience. By encouraging my leadership and professional growth, my membership in Phi Alpha Delta has further equipped me for a legal future. I have taken part in legal lectures, networking activities, and mock trials that mimic actual courtroom situations within the fraternity.In addition to providing me with useful skills, these experiences have reinforced my dedication to advocacy and legal integrity. A network of peers and mentors that support my path and assist me in developing the resilience required for the legal profession has been made available to me by Phi Alpha Delta. All things considered, these encounters have strengthened my resolve to seek a legal profession that prioritizes ethical responsibility and public service. I am acquiring theoretical information and practical skills that I plan to apply to my future legal practice by interacting with the community and learning about the workings of politics and the law. Based on my experiences as a canvasser and active member of Phi Alpha Delta, this foundation has motivated me to keep looking for opportunities that would help me grow. I am motivated to use my developing knowledge of political science and pre-law courses in the future to pursue a profession that upholds moral principles and public service while also advocating for justice. My active participation in Phi Alpha Delta and my practical experience as a canvasser have given me a deep understanding of how laws and policies impact society. I am excited to expand on this foundation as I pursue my education, looking into other ways to support my community, encourage politically informed participation, and eventually work in the legal system to support laws that advance accessibility and justice for all.
